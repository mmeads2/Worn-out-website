        Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other
        animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is
        applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
        including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An
        alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily,
        often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived
        from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains,
        but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers
        such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low in
        fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber
        and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace
        elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C,
        and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be
        a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular
        disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared
        with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and
        vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an
        approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart
        disease or stroke. The nutritional content of vegetables varies
        considerably; some contain useful amounts of protein though generally
        they contain little fat, and varying proportions of vitamins such as
        vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6; provitamins; dietary minerals;
        and carbohydrates.

          alt="various types of fruits" />
        Plant scientists have classified fruits into three main groups: simple
        fruits, aggregate fruits, and multiple (or composite) fruits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple fleshy fruits from apples to berries to watermelon; simple dry
        fruits including beans and rice, coconuts and carrots; aggregate
        fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pawpaw;
        multiple fruits such as pineapple, fig, mulberries; (see above re
        all)â€” are commercially valuable as human food. They are eaten both
        fresh and as jams, marmalade and other fruit preserves. They are used
        extensively in manufactured and processed foods (cakes, cookies, baked
        goods, flavorings, ice cream, yogurt, canned vegetables, frozen
        vegetables and meals) and beverages such as fruit juices and alcoholic
        beverages (brandy, fruit beer, wine). Spices like vanilla, black
        pepper, paprika, and allspice are derived from berries. Olive fruit is
        pressed for olive oil and similar processing is applied to other oil
        bearing fruits/vegetables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various culinary fruits provide significant amounts of fiber and water
        and present significant resistance to chewing; many are generally high
        in vitamin C. An overview of numerous studies show that fruits (e.g.,
        whole apples or whole oranges) are very satisfying (filling) in the
        acts of simply eating and chewing them. The fiber consumed in eating
        fruit promote satiety and help to control weight gain and to provide
        cholesterol-lowering effects. Regular consumption of fruit is
        generally associated with reduced risks of several diseases and
        functional declines associated with aging. A current review for
        meta-analyses concludes that even current assessments might
        significantly underestimate the protective associations of regularly
        eating fruits and vegetables.
